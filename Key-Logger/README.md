# Key-Logger
Records user keystrokes and save them in a text file called keylog. The text file is stored locally.

## For Educational Purpose
  I wanted to create a project relating to cybersecurity. A key logger seems to be a great start!

## How To Run
  Open powershell, navigate to the file directory, then type `g++ keylogger.cpp -o keylogger.exe` and press ENTER  
  Then type and enter `.\keylogger.cpp`  
  It will create a text file called keylog.txt. That is where key logs are saved.  
  To stop the program ctrl+c on powershell.

## Next Steps:
  - Have the option to send the txt file automatically as an email.
  - Clean up the code.
